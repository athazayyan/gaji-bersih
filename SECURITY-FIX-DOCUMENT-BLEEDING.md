# Security Fix: Prevent Document Bleeding Between Users

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Cross-user document exposure vulnerability  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔴 Security Vulnerability Identified

### The Problem

With the previous implementation where `buildAttributeFilter()` returned `undefined`, OpenAI's file_search would return results from **ALL files in both vector stores**, potentially exposing:

❌ **User A's employment contract** → visible in **User B's chat**  
❌ **User B's payslips** → visible in **User A's chat**  
✅ **Government regulations** → accessible to everyone (intended)

### Root Cause

When we removed the attribute filter to fix GLOBAL_STORE access, we inadvertently removed ALL filtering, including the security boundary between users.

```typescript
// INSECURE CODE (removed)
export function buildAttributeFilter(userId: string): AttributeFilter | undefined {
  return undefined  // ⚠️ No filtering = cross-user bleeding!
}
```

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Using OR Compound Filter

Based on [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/retrieval#attribute-filtering), we implement a **compound OR filter** that allows:

1. ✅ **User's own documents** (with matching `user_id`)
2. ✅ **Public regulations** (with `doc_type = "regulation"`)
3. ❌ **Other users' documents** (filtered out)

### Implementation

#### 1. Updated `buildAttributeFilter()` Function

**File:** `/lib/openai/responses.ts`

```typescript
export function buildAttributeFilter(
  userId: string,
  chatId?: string
): AttributeFilter | undefined {
  // OR filter: Match user's documents OR public regulations
  // This prevents "bleeding" of other users' documents
  return {
    type: 'or',
    filters: [
      // User's own documents (BIG_STORE files with user_id)
      {
        type: 'eq',
        key: 'user_id',
        value: userId,
      },
      // Public regulations (GLOBAL_STORE files marked as regulations)
      {
        type: 'eq',
        key: 'doc_type',
        value: 'regulation',
      },
    ],
  }
}
```

#### 2. Updated Regulation Upload Endpoint

**File:** `/app/api/admin/regulations/upload/route.ts`

```typescript
// Prepare metadata attributes for OpenAI
const attributes: any = {
  doc_type: 'regulation',  // ⭐ CRITICAL: Allows OR filter to include regulations
  regulation_type: metadata.regulation_type,
  regulation_number: metadata.regulation_number,
  regulation_year: metadata.regulation_year.toString(),
  title: metadata.title,
  source: 'admin',
}
```

#### 3. Migration Script for Existing Regulations

**File:** `/scripts/migrate-regulation-attributes.ts`

Created a migration script to update all 10 existing regulations in GLOBAL_STORE to have the `doc_type: "regulation"` attribute.

## 🔒 Security Analysis

### What's Protected

| Scenario | Before Fix | After Fix |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| User A queries their contract | ✅ Sees own contract | ✅ Sees own contract |
| User A queries regulations | ❌ No results | ✅ Sees regulations |
| User A queries User B's contract | ⚠️ **MIGHT SEE IT** | ✅ Blocked by filter |
| User A queries generic question | ⚠️ **Could cite B's docs** | ✅ Only own + regulations |

### Filter Logic

The OR filter works as follows:

```
OpenAI file_search will return a file IF:
  (file.user_id == current_user.id) 
  OR 
  (file.doc_type == "regulation")

This means:
- User A's documents: user_id=A → ✅ Matched for User A
- User B's documents: user_id=B → ❌ Not matched for User A
- Regulations: doc_type=regulation → ✅ Matched for everyone
```

### Additional Security Layer

Even with the OR filter, we maintain database-level security in `buildSourceCitations()`:

```typescript
// Line 248 in app/api/chat/route.ts
const { data: doc } = await (supabase.from('documents') as any)
  .select('*')
  .eq('file_id', citation.file_id)
  .eq('user_id', userId)  // ✅ RLS policy enforcement
  .single()
```

This provides **defense in depth**:
1. **First layer:** OpenAI filter (prevents search results)
2. **Second layer:** Database RLS (prevents citation retrieval)

## 📋 Migration Steps

To apply this fix to your existing system:

### Step 1: Update Code (Done)
- ✅ Updated `buildAttributeFilter()` with OR filter
- ✅ Updated regulation upload to set `doc_type: "regulation"`

### Step 2: Migrate Existing Regulations

Run the migration script to update all 10 existing regulations:

```bash
cd /home/notsuperganang/Documents/dev/infest/gaji-bersih
export $(cat .env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)
npx tsx scripts/migrate-regulation-attributes.ts
```

Expected output:
```
📋 Migrating regulation attributes...
Found 10 regulations to update

Updating: UU No. 13 Tahun 2003 tentang Ketenagakerjaan
  ✅ Updated successfully

...

📊 Migration Summary
Total regulations: 10
Successfully updated: 10 ✅
Failed: 0 ❌

🎉 All regulations migrated successfully!
```

### Step 3: Verify Security

Test that the fix works:

```bash
# Test 1: User can access their own documents
curl -s -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat_id":"<chat_id>","message":"Berapa gaji pokok saya?","include_web_search":false}' \
  | jq '.sources.contract_citations | length'
# Expected: > 0

# Test 2: User can access regulations
curl -s -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat_id":"<chat_id>","message":"Apa isi UU 13/2003?","include_web_search":false}' \
  | jq '.sources.regulation_citations | length'
# Expected: > 0

# Test 3: User CANNOT access other users' documents
# (This is harder to test without multiple users, but the filter ensures it)
```

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ Advantages

1. **Secure by default:** Users can only see their own documents
2. **Regulations accessible:** All users can query government regulations
3. **OpenAI-level filtering:** Prevention happens at search time, not post-processing
4. **Efficient:** Single file_search tool for both stores
5. **Maintainable:** Clear security boundary via `doc_type` attribute

### 📊 Performance

- **Latency:** Same as before (single file_search call)
- **Token usage:** Same as before (10 results max)
- **Storage cost:** No change (same files, just updated attributes)

### 🔄 Scalability

This approach scales well:
- **New users:** Their documents automatically get `user_id` attribute
- **New regulations:** Admin uploads automatically set `doc_type: "regulation"`
- **No manual intervention:** Filters work automatically

## 📚 OpenAI Documentation Reference

This implementation is based on OpenAI's official documentation:

- [Attribute Filtering](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/retrieval#attribute-filtering)
- [Compound Filters](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/retrieval#attribute-filtering) (OR/AND logic)
- [File Attributes](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/retrieval#attributes)

Key insight from docs:
> "Use **comparison filters** to compare a specific `key` in a file's `attributes` with a given `value`, and **compound filters** to combine multiple filters using `and` and `or`."

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Run migration script to update existing regulations
2. ⏳ Test with multiple user accounts to verify isolation
3. ⏳ Monitor logs for any filter-related issues

### Future Enhancements
1. Add `doc_type` to user documents (e.g., "contract", "payslip") for finer filtering
2. Implement audit logging for cross-user access attempts
3. Add rate limiting per user to prevent enumeration attacks
4. Consider adding document expiration for ephemeral uploads
